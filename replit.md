# Pipeline Corrosion Detection System

## Overview

This is an AI-powered web application for detecting corrosion on subsea and cross-country oil & gas pipelines. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze pipeline images and identify potential corrosion areas, providing comprehensive reports for maintenance planning.

The application is built with Streamlit for the web interface and leverages OpenCV for image processing and computer vision algorithms. It provides specialized detection models optimized for different pipeline environments (subsea vs. cross-country).
